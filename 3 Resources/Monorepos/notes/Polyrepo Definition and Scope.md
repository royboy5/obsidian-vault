## Polyrepo Definition and Scope

## Core Idea
*This is the single concept, explained in my own words.  This forces me to process the information (encode it) rather than just copy-pasting.*
- Multiple Repositories - Each project, component, service, or library is stored in its own separate repository.  This architecture promotes modularity, allowing teams to work independently on their respective projects with dedicated repositories.  It is often used in microservice architectures.  

## Connections
*How does this idea relate to what I already know?*
- It's the opposite of ... [[Monorepo Definition and Scope]]
- It's used in ... [Microservice Architectures]

## Open Questions
*What does this make me wonder about? What am I still curious about?*
- [Q - When should you use a polyrepo vs monorepo]
