## Hono Core Definition and Scope

## Core Idea
*This is the single concept, explained in my own words.  This forces me to process the information (encode it) rather than just copy-pasting.*

Hono - _**means flame🔥 in Japanese**_ - is a web framework built on Web Standards (https://www.w3.org/ and https://whatwg.org/).  This means, this framework will work on any JavaScript runtime.  JavaScript and TypeScript are the primary languages used for development of APIs and web applications.  Also, known to be lightweight and fast.  Has middleware support (like express js) and has a clean, expressive routing API.  Hono is also "Edge-Ready", meaning it will work seamlessly in the edge runtimes like Cloudflare workers or Deno deploy.
