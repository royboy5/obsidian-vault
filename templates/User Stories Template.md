### **User Stories Template**

User stories focus on the "who," "what," and "why" of a feature from the user's perspective. They are best kept in a simple list or table format. You can create this as the `To-Do App - User Stories.md` note in your project folder.

**Format:** As a **[type of user]**, I want to **[perform some action]** so that I can **[achieve some goal]**.

**Priority Levels:**

- `P2` - Nice to have
